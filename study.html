            <p>This is my study page, here I will tell you something about my study. I study at the University of Groningen. 
                In 2020 I started here. I started with the study Information Sciences. Here I followed courses such as Webtechnology and 
                Webprogramming, where I worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. However, this was three years ago. I finished my first year with an 8 average, however I 
                felt like it was not the study for me. So The next year I started Communication and Information Sciences.

                    <h3>HTML</h3>
                    <p> My HTML skills are I would say intermediate. Proficient in leveraging the latest features and semantic elements for creating well-structured documents.
                        Experienced in designing interactive and accessible forms, ensuring a smooth user input process.
                        Skilled in integrating audio and video elements, providing a rich multimedia experience. HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, serves as the backbone of web development by providing the structure and content for web pages. It is a markup language that utilizes tags to define various elements on a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. HTML acts as the foundation for presenting information on the internet, offering a standardized structure that browsers can interpret and display to users.

                        In HTML, developers create documents composed of nested elements, forming a hierarchical structure that represents the organization of content on a webpage. Different tags are just a few examples of the building blocks that define the layout and content of a webpage.
                        
                        HTML works in conjunction with cascading style sheets (CSS) for styling and presentation, and often incorporates JavaScript for enhancing interactivity and dynamic features. With the latest HTML5 specifications, developers have access to advanced features, including native support for multimedia elements, form validation, and improved semantics for better accessibility.
                        
                        In summary, HTML is the fundamental language for creating the structure and content of web pages. It serves as the cornerstone upon which CSS and JavaScript build, collectively allowing developers to create visually appealing, interactive, and dynamic websites for a seamless user experience.</p>

                    <h3>CSS</h3>
                    <p>My CSS skills I would also say are intermediate. 
                        Cascading Style Sheets, commonly known as CSS, is a fundamental technology used in web development to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. CSS enables developers to style web pages, making them visually appealing and user-friendly. With CSS, one can define the appearance of elements like text, colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning, providing a consistent and cohesive design across a website. The "cascading" nature of CSS allows styles to be applied in a hierarchical manner, with rules from different sources combining to determine the final appearance of elements. CSS is essential for creating responsive and adaptable designs, ensuring that websites look polished on various devices and screen sizes. It simplifies the process of separating content from presentation, making it easier to maintain and update the visual aspects of a website. Learning CSS is a key skill for web developers, as it plays a crucial role in shaping the user experience on the internet.</p>

                    <h3>Programming Skills</h3>
                    <p>JavaScript and PHP are two powerful scripting languages that play crucial roles in web development, often working together to create dynamic and interactive websites.

                        JavaScript is a client-side scripting language that runs in the browser, enabling developers to add interactivity and manipulate the content of a webpage in real-time. It is widely used for tasks such as form validation, creating animations, and updating the user interface without requiring a page reload. JavaScript has become essential for building modern, responsive web applications, and its versatility allows developers to work with various frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, or Vue.js.
                        
                        PHP, on the other hand, is a server-side scripting language designed for web development. It is embedded within HTML code and executed on the server, generating dynamic content before it is sent to the client's browser. PHP is particularly well-suited for tasks like handling form data, interacting with databases, and performing server-side processing. It is a versatile language commonly used in conjunction with databases like MySQL to build robust and data-driven web applications.
                        
                        Together, JavaScript and PHP form a powerful duo in web development. JavaScript handles client-side interactivity, enhancing the user experience, while PHP manages server-side tasks, processing data and generating dynamic content. This collaboration allows developers to create feature-rich and responsive web applications that seamlessly interact with users and databases. Understanding both languages is essential for building comprehensive and functional web solutions.</p>
